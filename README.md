This is the `Qt` and `OpenCV` implementation for the <b>Pediatric Perimetry</b> test.

This is just for the Authors reference of the project timeline and the windows implementation is in the <i>PediPeri_exe</i> repository

The code works successfully on the author's computer but is known to generate issues in other PCs. Still working on it.
